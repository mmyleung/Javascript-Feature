# Feature
I want to build a game inspired by Mei in Totoro and the soot dust ghosts.

Planning

Writing pseudocode
Initialise HTML, JS and CSS files
Create grid
Find image of Mei's foot/shoe and soot ghost and black foot print
Score div
Function = Make soot ghost appear randomly on the grid
At 3 seconds, soot ghost disappear and repeat function above
Mei will be cursor
When cursor clicks on soot ghost then score increases by 10
Game lasts for 1 minute
When 1 minute finishes then game over and display final score


Trouble shooting
Unsure how to append soot ghost onto div
spoke to a peer
add id to each div assign to div

after adding handprint the soot ghost element appends to the same div
I realised that is because I defined it globally so it doesn't repeat the math random function
