# Feature
I want to build a game inspired by Mei in Totoro and the soot dust ghosts.

Planning

Writing pseudocode
Initialise HTML, JS and CSS files
Create grid
Find image of Mei's hat and soot ghost and black foot print
Score div
Function = Make soot ghost appear randomly on the grid
At 10 seconds, soot ghost disappear and repeat function above
Initialise Mei at lower left corner of grid
Allow Mei to move up, down, left, right within boundaries of the grid
When Mei touches a soot ghost then score increases by 10
Game lasts for 1 minute
When 1 minute finishes then game over and display final score
